        <h3> Hi everyone!</h3>
        <br>
        <h3> This is my first project on Visual Studio Code and yet I am really enjoying it! I am loving the features and my mind is filled up with new ideas blasting every minute. </h3>
 <h3> I have used a similar app called 'Brackets' during a few of my classes and I think using Brackets has helped me in understanding the concept of coding apps & websites. I am wondering whether I can write E-books (Books written online on a device).
     <br>
     <h2> Can coding really change the world?</h2> 
     <h3> Coding is an woderful change to the world and I believe that it can help us a lot in various types of fields such as; Medical, Economical etc.</h3>
     <h3> 1. I think that other schools & collages should also use E-portals as it wil strengthen their understanding of various concepts and make learning fun</h3>
    <br>
    <h3> 2. It can be used to solve real-life problems such as; Farmers can use apps to calculate the area they have, the government can use apps to solve financial problems and more</h3>
<h3>and much more </h3>
